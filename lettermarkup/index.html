    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017
        </li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.

    <p>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</p>
    <p>For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page.</p>
    <p>Yours sincerely, <br>
